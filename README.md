#  Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation From Scratch

## Overview
ðŸš€ Welcome to our Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation Project! ðŸš€

In this project, we proudly present a collection of meticulously crafted machine learning algorithms developed from scratch. Our implementation covers a broad spectrum of tasks in both classification and regression.

### Classification Algorithms
For classification enthusiasts, we've brought to life the following algorithms:

- **Adaline**: Adaptive Linear Neuron. A binary classification maestro adjusting weights based on continuous prediction error.
- **Pocket**: A Perceptron enhancement that cherishes the best weight vector during training.
- **Kernels**: A voyage into kernel-based classification algorithms, where dimensions transcend to new heights.
- **Perceptron**: A simple linear classifier on a mission to neatly categorize input patterns into two classes.
- **Logistic Regression**: A maestro in modeling the probability of binary outcomes.
- **Soft Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: Witness the charm of both Hard_SVC and Soft_SVC for non-linear classification wonders.
- **Polynomial Transformation**: Adaline, Perceptron, and Pocket undergo a magical transformation to conquer non-linear decision boundaries.

### Regression Algorithms
For regression aficionados, our lineup includes:

- **Simple Linear Regression**: A linear dance modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and a lone independent variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: An orchestra of relationships between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable.
- **Polynomial Regression**: A symphony of regression where the relationship follows an nth-degree polynomial.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: A journey into SVR territory, featuring both SVR-Hard and SVR-Soft versions.
- **Covering Number**: A metric revealing the complexity of the hypothesis space.
